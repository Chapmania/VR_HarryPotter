# Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts

### Play the game!

You can play the game in VR by downloading the game_exe directory.

### Description

This was my team's final project for our VR class! We made a survival "shooter" where you cast magic spells by the flick of your wand.

You are a wizard/witch trapped in Gringotts, and hordes of skeletons are trying to attack you! With only a spell book and trusty wand in hand, you must fight to survive! Also, try to aim to get the highest score!


## Controls

To cast a spell, hold down the index finger trigger on the right controller, flick your hand (while still holding down the trigger), then release the trigger at the end of the flick.
